abstract = {AbstractMotivated by the analysis of imaging data, we propose a novel functional varying-coefficient single-index model (FVCSIM) to carry out the regression analysis of functional response data on a set of covariates of interest. FVCSIM represents a new extension of varying-coefficient single-index models for scalar responses collected from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. An efficient estimation procedure is developed to iteratively estimate varying coefficient functions, link functions, index parameter vectors, and the covariance function of individual functions. We systematically examine the asymptotic properties of all estimators including the weak convergence of the estimated varying coefficient functions, the asymptotic distribution of the estimated index parameter vectors, and the uniform convergence rate of the estimated covariance function and their spectrum. Simulation studies are carried out to assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed procedure. We apply FVCSIM to investiga...},

abstract = {Inbred strains of mice make useful models to study bone properties. Our aim was to compare bone competence and cortical morphometric parameters of two inbred strains to better determine the role of bone structure and geometry in the process of bone failure. Morphometric analysis was performed on 20 murine femora with a low bone mass (C57BL/6J; B6) and 20 murine femora with a high bone mass (C3H/HeJ; C3H) using desktop microCT. The bones were tested under three-point bending to measure their mechanical properties. Results showed that the C3H strain is a more reproducible model regarding bone morphometric and mechanical phenotypes than the B6 strain. Bone strength, stiffness, yield force, yield displacement, and toughness, as well as morphometric traits, were all significantly different between the two strains, whereas postyield displacement was not. It was found that bone volume, cortical thickness, and cross-sectional area predicted almost 80{\%} (p {\textless} 0.05) of bone stiffness, strength, and yield force. Nevertheless, cortical bone postyield properties such as bone toughness could not be explained by morphometry, but postyield whitening was observed in that phase. In conclusion, we found that morphometric parameters are strong predictors of preyield but not postyield properties. The lack of morphometric influence on bone competence in the postyield phase in combination with the observed postyield whitening confirmed the important contribution of ultrastructure and microdamage in the process of overall bone failure behavior, especially in the postyield phase.},

@article{Jee2005,
abstract = {It was not until the 1950s that a better paradigm for bone biology evolved, which led to the birth of bone histomorphometry. Two clinicians, Harold Frost (1958-1964) and Lent Johnson (1964), were responsible for the paradigm stating that the primary function of bone is mechanical load bearing with subsidiary function to participate in plasma calcium homeostasis to support hematopoesis. Dynamic bone histomorphometry was born when Milch et al. (1958) discovered bone localization of tetracycline and Frost generated the methodology to study tetracycline-based dynamic histological analysis of cortical bone remodeling (1961-1965). Dynamic bone histomorphometry did not blossom until Frost, while a Sun Valley Workshop participant, developed it to address trabecular bone dynamics. The combination of Arnold (1948) producing thin sections of plastic-embedded undecalcified bone and Frost's (1977-1983) modification of dynamic cortical bone histology for cancellous bone made it possible to study tetracycline-based dynamic histomorphometry of cancellous bone. It led to the better understanding of basic metabolic unit (BMU) remodelling and to Frost's mechanostat hypothesis, and characterized the rat model to accelerate the development of several drugs in the treatment of bone diseases. Currently, dynamic bone histomorphometry has contributed to studies in bone's mechanical usage windows, mechanical usage setpoint hypothesis, muscle-bone relations, marrow-bone relations, the Utah paradigm of musculoskeletal physiology, apoptosis, genetics (transgenic mice) and bone structure, bone quality, the lacunocanalicular network and bone modelling, and remodeling hypothesis, osteocyte role as mechanosensory, chemosensory, and regulatory in bone maintenance, targeted and untargeted remodeling, the role of permissive agents, etc., items in bone biology expounded briefly by Lent Johnson (1965) and continuously by Harold Frost at the Sun Valley Workshop (1965-2003). Finally, "What's next?" covers how to improve and perpetuate the employing of qualitative histomorphometry in research opportunities in hard tissue research.},

abstract = {The origin of tetrapods from their fish antecedents, approximately 400 million years ago, was coupled with the origin of terrestrial locomotion and the evolution of supporting limbs. Polypterus is a member of the basal-most group of ray-finned fish (actinopterygians) and has many plesiomorphic morphologies that are comparable to elpistostegid fishes, which are stem tetrapods. Polypterus therefore serves as an extant analogue of stem tetrapods, allowing us to examine how developmental plasticity affects the 'terrestrialization' of fish. We measured the developmental plasticity of anatomical and biomechanical responses in Polypterus reared on land. Here we show the remarkable correspondence between the environmentally induced phenotypes of terrestrialized Polypterus and the ancient anatomical changes in stem tetrapods, and we provide insight into stem tetrapod behavioural evolution. Our results raise the possibility that environmentally induced developmental plasticity facilitated the origin of the terrestrial traits that led to tetrapods.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if 3-dimensional (3D) shape analysis precisely diagnoses right and left differences in asymmetry patients.

STUDY DESIGN: Cone-beam computerized tomography (CT) data were acquired before treatment from 20 patients with mandibular asymmetry. 3D shape analysis was used to localize and quantify the extent of virtually simulated asymmetry. Two approaches were used: 1) mirroring on the midsagittal plane determined from landmarks; and 2) mirroring on an arbitrary plane and then registering on the cranial base of the original image. The validation presented in this study used simulated data and was applied to 3 clinical cases.

RESULTS: For mirroring on the midsagittal plane, there was a {\textgreater}99{\%} probability that the difference between measured and simulated asymmetry was {\textless}0.5 mm. For mirroring with cranial base registration, there was a {\textgreater}84{\%} probability of differences {\textless}0.5 mm.

CONCLUSIONS: Mandibular asymmetry can be precisely quantified with both mirroring methods. Cranial base registration has the potential to be used for patients with trauma situations or when key landmarks are unreliable or absent.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess 3D morphological variations and local and systemic biomarker profiles in subjects with a diagnosis of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA).

DESIGN: Twenty-eight patients with long-term TMJ OA (39.9 ± 16 years), 12 patients at initial diagnosis of OA (47.4 ± 16.1 years), and 12 healthy controls (41.8 ± 12.2 years) were recruited. All patients were female and had cone beam CT scans taken. TMJ arthrocentesis and venipuncture were performed on 12 OA and 12 age-matched healthy controls. Serum and synovial fluid levels of 50 biomarkers of arthritic inflammation were quantified by protein microarrays. Shape Analysis MANCOVA tested statistical correlations between biomarker levels and variations in condylar morphology.

RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, the OA average condyle was significantly smaller in all dimensions except its anterior surface, with areas indicative of bone resorption along the articular surface, particularly in the lateral pole. Synovial fluid levels of ANG, GDF15, TIMP-1, CXCL16, MMP-3 and MMP-7 were significantly correlated with bone apposition of the condylar anterior surface. Serum levels of ENA-78, MMP-3, PAI-1, VE-Cadherin, VEGF, GM-CSF, TGF$\beta$b1, IFN$\gamma$g, TNF$\alpha$a, IL-1$\alpha$a, and IL-6 were significantly correlated with flattening of the lateral pole. Expression levels of ANG were significantly correlated with the articular morphology in healthy controls.

CONCLUSIONS: Bone resorption at the articular surface, particularly at the lateral pole was statistically significant at initial diagnosis of TMJ OA. Synovial fluid levels of ANG, GDF15, TIMP-1, CXCL16, MMP-3 and MMP-7 were correlated with bone apposition.

@article{Schobel2013,
abstract = {VIDEO ABSTRACT: The hippocampus in schizophrenia is characterized by both hypermetabolism and reduced size. It remains unknown whether these abnormalities are mechanistically linked. Here we addressed this question by using MRI tools that can map hippocampal metabolism and structure in patients and mouse models. In at-risk patients, hypermetabolism was found to begin in CA1 and spread to the subiculum after psychosis onset. CA1 hypermetabolism at baseline predicted hippocampal atrophy, which occurred during progression to psychosis, most prominently in similar regions. Next, we used ketamine to model conditions of acute psychosis in mice. Acute ketamine reproduced a similar regional pattern of hypermetabolism, while repeated exposure shifted the hippocampus to a hypermetabolic basal state with concurrent atrophy and pathology in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Parallel invivo experiments using the glutamate-reducing drug LY379268 and direct measurements of extracellular glutamate showed that glutamate drives both neuroimaging abnormalities. These findings show that hippocampal hypermetabolism leads to atrophy in psychotic disorder and suggest glutamate as a pathogenic driver.},

abstract = {One goal of statistical shape analysis is the discrimination between two populations of objects. Whereas traditional shape analysis was mostly concerned with single objects, analysis of multi-object complexes presents new challenges related to alignment and pose. In this paper, we present a methodology for discriminant analysis of multiple objects represented by sampled medial manifolds. Non-euclidean metrics that describe geodesic distances between sets of sampled representations are used for alignment and discrimination. Our choice of discriminant method is the distance-weighted discriminant because of its generalization ability in high-dimensional, low sample size settings. Using an unbiased, soft discrimination score, we associate a statistical hypothesis test with the discrimination results. We explore the effectiveness of different choices of features as input to the discriminant analysis, using measures like volume, pose, shape, and the combination of pose and shape. Our method is applied to a longitudinal pediatric autism study with 10 subcortical brain structures in a population of 70 subjects. It is shown that the choices of type of global alignment and of intrinsic versus extrinsic shape features, the latter being sensitive to relative pose, are crucial factors for group discrimination and also for explaining the nature of shape change in terms of the application domain.},

Histopathological and in vivo labeling studies demonstrate that this loss occurs most extensively in the caudal putamen and caudate head. Previous structural studies have suggested reduced striatal volume and atrophy of the caudate head in PD subjects. The spatial distribution of atrophy in the putamen, however, has not been characterized. We aimed to delineate the specific locations of atrophy in both of these striatal structures. T1- and T2-weighted brain MR (3T) images were obtained from 40 PD and 40 control subjects having no dementia and similar age and gender distributions. Shape analysis was performed using doubly segmented regions of interest. Compared to controls, PD subjects had lower putamen (p = 0.0003) and caudate (p = 0.0003) volumes. Surface contraction magnitudes were greatest on the caudal putamen (p ≤ 0.005) and head and dorsal body of the caudate (p ≤ 0.005). This spatial distribution of striatal atrophy is consistent with the known pattern of dopamine depletion in PD and may reflect global consequences of known cellular remodeling phenomena.},

abstract = {The skull of young children is made up of bony plates that enable growth. Craniosynostosis is a birth defect that causes one or more sutures on an infant's skull to close prematurely. Corrective surgery focuses on cranial and orbital rim shaping to return the skull to a more normal shape. Functional problems caused by craniosynostosis such as speech and motor delay can improve after surgical correction, but a post-surgical analysis of brain development in comparison with age-matched healthy controls is necessary to assess surgical outcome. Full brain segmentations obtained from pre- and post-operative computed tomography (CT) scans of 8 patients with single suture sagittal (n=5) and metopic (n=3), non-syndromic craniosynostosis from 41 to 452 days-of-age were included in this study. Age-matched controls obtained via 4D acceleration-based regression of a cohort of 402 full brain segmentations from healthy controls magnetic resonance images (MRI) were also used for comparison (ages 38 to 825 days). 3D point-based models of patient and control cohorts were obtained using SPHARM-PDM shape analysis tool. From a full dataset of regressed shapes, 240 healthy regressed shapes between 30 and 588 days-of-age (time step = 2.34 days) were selected. Volumes and shape metrics were obtained for craniosynostosis and healthy age-matched subjects. Volumes and shape metrics in single suture craniosynostosis patients were larger than age-matched controls for pre- and post-surgery. The use of 3D shape and volumetric measurements show that brain growth is not normal in patients with single suture craniosynostosis.},

In this study, we performed hippocampal shape analysis in cannabis-using and non-using patients with schizophrenia, healthy cannabis users and healthy non-using controls. Hippocampal shape changes were observed in each group relative to controls, with the greatest degree of alterations (i.e., deflations across the hippocampus, and with an anterior predisposition), in cannabis-using schizophrenia patients. These alterations were associated with cannabis use patterns and psychotic symptoms.},

abstract = {Animal model-based studies have shown that ethanol exposure during early gestation induces developmental stage-specific abnormalities of the face and brain. The exposure time-dependent variability in ethanol's teratogenic outcomes is expected to contribute significantly to the wide spectrum of effects observed in humans with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The work presented here employs a mouse FASD model and magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM; high resolution magnetic resonance imaging) in studies designed to further our understanding of the developmental stage-specific defects of the brain that are induced by ethanol. At neurulation stages, i.e. at the beginning of gestational day (GD) 9 and again 4 hours later, time-mated C57Bl/6J dams were intraperitoneally administered 2.9 g/kg ethanol or vehicle. Ethanol-exposed fetuses were collected on GD 17, processed for MRM analysis, and results compared to comparably staged controls. Linear and volume measurements as well as shape changes for numerous individual brain regions were determined. GD 9 ethanol exposure resulted in significantly increased septal region width, reduction of cerebellar volume, and enlargement of all of the ventricles. Additionally, the results of shape analyses showed that many areas of the ethanol-exposed brains including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and right striatum were significantly misshapen. These data demonstrate that ethanol can induce dysmorphology that may not be obvious based on volumetric analyses alone, highlight the asymmetric aspects of ethanol-induced defects, and add to our understanding of ethanol's developmental stage-dependent neuroteratogenesis.},

abstract = {The simulation of pituitary gland surgery requires a precise classification of soft tissues, vessels and bones. Bone structures tend to be thin and have diffuse edges in CT data, and thus the common method of thresholding can produce incomplete segmentations. In this paper, we present a novel multi-scale sheet enhancement measure and apply it to paranasal sinus bone segmentation. The measure uses local shape information obtained from an eigenvalue decomposition of the Hessian matrix. It attains a maximum in the middle of a sheet, and also provides local estimates of its width and orientation. These estimates are used to create a vector field orthogonal to bone boundaries, so that a flux maximizing flow algorithm can be applied to recover them. Hence, the sheetness measure has the essential properties to be incorporated into the computation of anatomical models for the simulation of pituitary surgery, enabling it to better account for the presence of sinus bones. We validate the approach quantitatively on ...},

Factors regulating human NLRP3 activity that contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity of NLRP3-related diseases have largely been inferred from the study of Nlrp3 mutant mice. By generating a mouse line in which the NLRP3 locus is humanized by syntenic replacement, we show the functioning of the human NLRP3 proteins invivo, demonstrating the ability of the human inflammasome to orchestrate immune reactions in response to innate stimuli. Humanized mice expressing disease-associated mutations develop normally but display acute sensitivity to endotoxin and develop progressive and debilitating arthritis characterized by granulocytic infiltrates, elevated cytokines, erosion of bones, and osteoporosis. This NLRP3-dependent arthritis model provides a platform for testing therapeutic reagents targeting the human inflammasome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND This study is to investigate the effect of fenofibrate on the bone quality of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mouse model. METHODS T2DM mouse model was induced by high-fat-diet, and the mice were treated with fenofibrate (100mg/kg) (DIO-FENO) or PBS (DIO-PBS) for 4weeks. The bone microstructure and biomechanical properties of femora were analyzed by micro-CT and 3-Point bending test. The protein expression was detected by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot. The cell apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining. The Bcl2, caspase 3, and osteoblast marker genes were detected by RT-qPCR. RESULTS The biomechanical properties of bones from DIO-FENO group were significantly lower than those in the control and DIO-PBS groups. Besides, the trabecular number was lower than those of the other groups, though the cortical porosity was decreased compared with that of DIO-PBS group because of the increase of apoptotic cells. The expression of osteocalcin and collagen I were decreased after treatment with fenofibrate in T2DM mice. Moreover, the cell viability was decreased after treated with different concentrations of fenofibrate, and the expression of Runx2 decreased after treated with high dose of fenofibrate. CONCLUSION Fenofibrate decreases the bone quality of T2DM mice through decreasing the expression of collagen I and osteocalcin, which may be resulted from the down regulation of Runx2 expression.},

abstract = {Preclinical models for musculoskeletal disorders are critical for understanding the pathogenesis of bone and joint disorders in humans and the development of effective therapies. The assessment of these models primarily relies on morphological analysis which remains time consuming and costly, requiring large numbers of animals to be tested through different stages of the disease. The implementation of preclinical imaging represents a keystone in the refinement of animal models allowing longitudinal studies and enabling a powerful, non-invasive and clinically translatable way for monitoring disease progression in real time. Our aim is to highlight examples that demonstrate the advantages and limitations of different imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and optical imaging. All of which are in current use in preclinical skeletal research. MRI can provide high resolution of soft tissue structures, but imaging requires comparatively long acquisition times; hence, animals require long-term anaesthesia. CT is extensively used in bone and joint disorders providing excellent spatial resolution and good contrast for bone imaging. Despite its excellent structural assessment of mineralized structures, CT does not provide in vivo functional information of ongoing biological processes. Nuclear medicine is a very promising tool for investigating functional and molecular processes in vivo with new tracers becoming available as biomarkers. The combined use of imaging modalities also holds significant potential for the assessment of disease pathogenesis in animal models of musculoskeletal disorders, minimising the use of conventional invasive methods and animal redundancy.},

abstract = {Wound healing requires interactions between coagulation, inflammation, angiogenesis, cellular migration, and proliferation. Healing in dermal wounds of hemophilia B mice is delayed when compared with hemostatically normal wild-type (WT) mice, with abnormal persistence of iron deposition, inflammation, and neovascularity. We observed healing following induced joint hemorrhage in WT and factor IX (FIX) knockout (FIX(-/-)) mice, examining also parameters previously studied in an excisional skin wound model. Hemostatically normal mice tolerated this joint bleeding challenge, cleared blood from the joint, and healed with minimal pathology, even if additional autologous blood was injected intra-articularly at the time of wounding. Following hemarthrosis, joint wound healing in hemophilia B mice was impaired and demonstrated similar abnormal histologic features as previously described in hemophilic dermal wounds. Therefore, studies of pathophysiology and therapy of hemophilic joint bleeding performed in hemostatically normal animals are not likely to accurately reflect the healing defect of hemophilia. We additionally explored the hypothesis that the use of a FIX replacement protein with extended circulating FIX activity could improve synovial and osteochondral wound healing in hemophilic mice, when compared with treatment with unmodified recombinant FIX (rFIX) in the established joint bleeding model. Significantly improved synovial wound healing and preservation of normal osteochondral architecture are achieved by extending FIX activity after hemarthrosis using glycoPEGylated FIX when compared with an equivalent dose of rFIX. These results suggest that treating joint bleeding only until hemostasis is achieved may not result in optimal joint healing, which is improved by extending factor activity.},

abstract = {While chronic degenerative arthropathy is the main morbidity of haemophilia, a very high prevalence of low bone density is also seen in men and boys with haemophilia. This study investigates bone degradation in the knee joint of haemophilic mice resulting from haemarthrosis and the efficacy of aggressive treatment with factor VIII in the period surrounding injury to prevent bone pathology. Skeletally mature factor VIII knock-out mice were subjected to knee joint haemorrhage induced by puncture of the left knee joint capsule. Mice received either intravenous factor VIII treatment or placebo immediately prior to injury and at hours 4, 24, 48, 72 and 96 after haemorrhage. Mice were killed 2-weeks after injury and the joint morphology and loss of bone in the proximal tibia was assessed using microCT imaging. Quantitative microCT imaging of the knee joint found acute bone loss at the proximal tibia following injury including loss of trabecular bone volumetric density and bone mineral density, as well as trabecular connectivity density, number and thickness. Unexpectedly, joint injury also resulted in calcification of the joint soft tissues including the tendons, ligaments, menisci and cartilage. Treatment with factor VIII prevented this bone and soft tissue degeneration. Knee joint haemorrhage resulted in acute changes in adjacent bone including loss of bone density and mineralization of joint soft tissues. The rapid calcification and loss of bone has implications for the initiation and progression of osteoarthritic degradation following joint bleeding.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of a limited number of experimental joint bleedings, combined with loading of the affected joint, on the development of progressive degenerative joint damage. METHODS The right knee of 8 mature beagle dogs was injected with freshly collected autologous blood 3 times per week for 4 weeks, to mimic a limited number of joint hemorrhages occurring over a short period. To ensure loading of the experimental joint, the contralateral control knee of the animals was fixed to the trunk 4 hours per day, 3 days per week. Ten weeks after the last injection, cartilage tissue and synovium were collected from both knees to analyze features of joint degeneration. Cartilage was prepared for analysis of proteoglycan turnover (synthesis, retention, release, and content) and histologic features. Synovium was prepared for histologic analysis. RESULTS The rate of proteoglycan synthesis was significantly increased, characteristic of degenerative cartilage damage as seen in osteoarthritis. Release of newly formed proteoglycans (as a measure of retention) and total loss of proteoglycans from the cartilage matrix were increased. Cartilage matrix integrity was adversely altered, as shown by histologic damage. Histologic analysis also revealed signs of synovial inflammation. These effects were not observed 10 weeks after the experimental bleedings in joints that did not undergo forced loading. CONCLUSION Experimental joint bleedings when combined with loading of the affected joint resulted in features of progressive degenerative joint damage, whereas similar joint hemorrhages without joint loading did not. This might reflect a possible mechanism of joint damage in hemophilia.},

METHODS AND RESULTS Cartilage and synovium from patients with HA (n=10), RA (n=8), OA (n=14) and normal control subjects (n=6) were examined morphologically, biochemically and histochemically. Cartilage in HA exhibited characteristics of degenerative joint disease (OA), as evidenced by morphological, histochemical (Safranin-O fast green-iron haematoxylin, Mankin grade) and biochemical (proteoglycan synthesis, glycosaminoglycan content and DNA content) changes, whereas synovium in HA showed characteristics of inflammation-mediated joint disease (RA), as evidenced by histochemical (inflammation, haematoxylin and eosin (H{\&}E) and iron deposition, Perls' blue) and biochemical changes (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and catabolic properties). CONCLUSION Haemophilic arthropathy shows characteristics of both inflammatory and degenerative joint disease. On the basis of these results and published information, it appears that degenerative cartilage changes have a dominant role in HA and are augmented by relatively mild inflammation of the synovium.},

Patients with haemophilia have several predisposing factors for developing decreased bone mineral density (BMD) including prolonged periods of immobility, reduced weight bearing and co-morbidities associated with bone loss. To establish prevalence and risk factors associated with decreased BMD in patients with haemophilia. Adults with moderate or severe haemophilia A or B underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BMD was correlated to laboratory values, joint mobility measurements and physical activity questionnaires. Thirty patients completed evaluations. The median age was 41.5 years (range 18-61). Median lowest T-score by DXA was -1.7 (range: -5.8 to +0.6), with the femoral neck being the site of the lowest T-scores. Based on World Health Organization criteria, 70{\%} of patients had decreased BMD. Twenty-seven per cent of the participants (n = 8) had osteoporosis and 43{\%} (n = 13) had osteopenia. Variables associated with increased bone loss included lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (P = 0.03), lower body mass index (P = 0.047), lower activity scores (P = 0.02), decreased joint range of motion (P = 0.046), HIV (P = 0.03), HCV (P = 0.02), history of inhibitor (P = 0.01) and age (P = 0.03). Adults with haemophilia are at increased risk for developing osteoporosis. A history of HCV and HIV infections, decreased joint range-of-motion, decreased activity levels, history of an inhibitor and low body weight predict bone loss and suggest a population to target for screening. A high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was observed. Future studies should investigate interventions, including vitamin D supplementation, to prevent bone loss and fractures for this at-risk population.},

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of bone disease in haemophiliacs and its association with potential risk factors. Adult patients with haemophilia A and B followed-up in the Haemophilia Centre of Northern Greece were included. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH) and great trochanter (GT). One-hundred four male patients (aged 45.8 ± 15.1 years) and 50 controls (aged 44.9 ± 12.8 years) were screened. Low BMD was diagnosed in 28 patients (26.9{\%}) and 10 controls (20{\%}) (p=0.0001). Patients had lower BMD in TH (p=0.007), FN (p=0.029) and GT (p=0.008) than controls, without differences in LS. BMD was positively associated with the severity of haemophilia, history of herpes virus C or human immunodeficiency virus and level of physical activity, and negatively with the level of arthropathy. In multiple-regression analysis, only the level of physical activity and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] significantly predicted BMD. Half of the patients had vitamin D deficiency. In conclusion, our study showed increased prevalence of low BMD in haemophiliacs. The levels of physical activity and 25(OH)D independently predicted low BMD.},

abstract = {A relationship between haemophilia and osteoporosis has been suggested, leading to the initiative for a larger study assessing this issue. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by osteodensitometry using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in 62 male patients with severe haemophilia A; mean age 41 +/- 13.1 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 23.5 +/- 3.6 kg m(-2). Using the clinical score suggested by the World Federation of Hemophilia, all patients were assessed to determine the severity of their arthropathy. A reduced BMD defined as osteopenia and osteoporosis by World Health Organization criteria was detected in 27/62 (43.5{\%}) and 16/62 (25.8{\%}) patients, respectively. Fifty-five of sixty-two (88.7{\%}) patients suffered from haemophilic arthropathy. An increased number of affected joints and/or an increased severity were associated with lower BMD in the neck of femur. Pronounced muscle atrophy and loss of joint movement were also associated with low BMD. Furthermore, hepatitis C, low BMI and age were found to be additional risk factors for reduced BMD in the haemophiliac. Our data shows that in haemophilic patients osteoporosis represents a frequent concomitant observation. The main cause for reduced bone mass in the haemophiliac is most probably the haemophilic arthropathy being typically associated with chronic pain and loss of joint function subsequently leading to inactivity. Further studies including control groups are necessary to elucidate the impact of comorbidities such as hepatitis C or HIV on the development of osteoporosis in the haemophiliac.},

	abstract = {<p>Automatic image analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) images of the knee is simplified by bringing the knee into a reference position. While the knee is typically put into a reference position during image acquisition, this alignment will generally not be perfect. To correct for imperfections, we propose a two-step process of bone segmentation followed by elastic tissue deformation. The approach makes use of a fully-automatic segmentation of femur and tibia from T1 and T2* images. The segmentation algorithm is based on a continuous convex optimization problem, incorporating regional, and shape information. The regional terms are included from a probabilistic viewpoint, which readily allows the inclusion of shape information. Segmentation of the outer boundary of the cortical bone is encouraged by adding simple appearance-based information to the optimization problem. The resulting segmentation without the shape alignment step is globally optimal.</p>

<p>Standard registration is problematic for knee alignment due to the distinct physical properties of the tissues constituting the knee (bone, muscle, etc.). We therefore develop an alternative alignment approach based on a simple elastic deformation model combined with strict enforcement of similarity transforms for femur and tibia based on the obtained segmentations.</p>

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To compare quantitative estimates of change in joint space width (JSW) with semiquantitative ratings of the progression of joint space narrowing (JSN) with respect to sensitivity to change over time. METHODS: 431 obese women 45 to 64 years old with unilateral radiographic knee osteoarthritis were randomised to 30 months' treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily or placebo. Quantitative estimates of change in JSW in the medial tibiofemoral compartment from fluoroscopically assisted semiflexed AP radiographs were obtained at baseline and 16 and 30 months after randomisation. Radiographic JSN was rated (0-3 scale) in the same images by two readers using a standard atlas. Changes in overall severity of knee osteoarthritis were derived from gradings of conventional standing AP radiographs at baseline and 30 months, with blinding to treatment group and chronological order of examination. RESULTS: Follow up radiographs were obtained from 381 subjects (88\%) at 16 months and from 367 (85\%) at 30 months. The treatment groups did not differ in the frequency of significant loss of JSW by dichotomous criteria (?0.5 mm, ?1.0 mm, ?20\%, or ?50\% of baseline JSW). Progressors and non-progressors, as defined by each of the dichotomous outcomes, differed significantly in mean value for quantitative measurement of change in JSW at 30 months (p?0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative and semiquantitative indicators of progression of osteoarthritis in fluoroscopically standardised radiographs of osteoarthritic knees are highly related, but the effect of doxycycline on articular cartilage thickness was more easily detected with quantitative measurements of change in JSW than with semiquantitative ratings of JSN.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: Minimum radiographic joint space width (mJSW) represents the FDA standard for demonstrating structural therapeutic benefits for knee osteoarthritis (KOA), but only shows moderate responsiveness (sensitivity to change). We directly compare the responsiveness of MRI-based cartilage thickness and JSW measures from fixed-flexion radiography (FFR) and explore the correlation of region-matched changes between both methods. METHODS: 967 knees of Osteoarthritis Initiative participants with radiographic KOA were studied: 445 over one year with coronal FLASH MRI and FFR, and 375/522 over one/two years with sagittal DESS MRI and FFR. Standardized response means (SRM) of cartilage thickness and mJSW were compared using the sign-test. RESULTS: With FLASH MRI, SRM was -0.28 for medial compartment (MFTC) cartilage loss vs. -0.15 for mJSW, and -0.32 vs. -0.22 for the most sensitive MRI subregion (central MFTC) vs. the most sensitive fixed location JSW(X=0.25). With DESS MRI, one-year SRM was -0.34 for MFTC vs. -0.22 for mJSW and -0.44 vs. -0.28 for central MFTC vs. JSW(X=0.225). Over two years, the SRM was significantly greater for MFTC than for mJSW (-0.43 vs. -0.31, p=0.017) and for central MFTC than for JSW(X=0.225) (-0.51 vs. -0.44, p<0.001). Correlations between changes in spatially matched MRI subregions and fixed location JSW were not consistently higher (r=0.10-0.51) than those between non-matched locations (r=0.15-0.50). CONCLUSIONS: MRI displays greater responsiveness in KOA than JSW FFR-based JSW, with the greatest SRM observed in the central medial femorotibial compartment. Fixed-location radiographic measures appear not capable of determining the spatial distribution of femorotibial cartilage loss.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To summarize literature on the responsiveness and reliability of MRI-based measures of knee osteoarthritis (OA) structural change. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using articles published up to the time of the search, April 2009. 1338 abstracts obtained with this search were preliminarily screened for relevance and of these, 243 were selected for data extraction. For this analysis we extracted data on reliability and responsiveness for every reported synovial joint tissue as it relates to MRI measurement in knee OA. Reliability was defined by inter- and intra-reader intra-class correlation (ICC), or coefficient of variation, or kappa statistics. Responsiveness was defined as standardized response mean (SRM) - ratio of mean of change over time divided by standard deviation of change. Random-effects models were used to pool data from multiple studies. RESULTS: The reliability analysis included data from 84 manuscripts. The inter-reader and intra-reader ICC were excellent (range 0.8-0.94) and the inter-reader and intra-reader kappa values for quantitative and semi-quantitative measures were all moderate to excellent (range 0.52-0.88). The lowest value (kappa = 0.52) corresponded to semi-quantitative synovial scoring intra-reader reliability and the highest value (ICC = 0.94) for semi-quantitative cartilage morphology. The responsiveness analysis included data from 42 manuscripts. The pooled SRM for quantitative measures of cartilage morphometry for the medial tibiofemoral joint was -0.86 (95\% confidence intervals (CI) -1.26 to -0.46). The pooled SRM for the semi-quantitative measurement of cartilage morphology for the medial tibiofemoral joint was 0.55 (95\% CI 0.47-0.64). For the quantitative analysis, SRMs are negative because the quantitative value, indicating a loss of cartilage, goes down. For the semi-quantitative analysis, SRMs indicating a loss in cartilage are positive (increase in score). CONCLUSION: MRI has evolved substantially over the last decade and its strengths include the ability to visualize individual tissue pathologies, which can be measured reliably and with good responsiveness using both quantitative and semi-quantitative techniques.},

	abstract = {Objectives Although the Kellgren and Lawrence (K\&amp;L) criteria for defining radiological osteoarthritis are widely used in epidemiological and clinical studies, the authors previously documented the existence of five different versions of these criteria. This study identifies the impact of the use of alternative versions of the K\&amp;L criteria and evaluates which description has the highest association with knee complaints. Methods Two readers scored most radiographs of the knees of participants of the Rotterdam Study with the original K\&amp;L description (90\%). In addition, each alternative description was used in a random part (20\%) of the radiographs. The authors calculated reproducibility of all descriptions, and compared sensitivity and specificity of the alternative descriptions for three cut-off points with the original description as reference standard (K\&amp;L>=1, K\&amp;L>=2 and K\&amp;L>=3). The authors calculated κ statistics to compare agreement between the original and alternative descriptions, and evaluated the association with knee complaints. Results The dataset comprises radiographs of knees of 3071 people. For cut-off K\&amp;L>=1 all four alternatives classified more people as having osteoarthritis than the original description; κ was low, and sensitivity and specificity were moderate to good. For cut-offs K\&amp;L>=2 and K\&amp;L>=3 there was little difference in the number of cases and κ, sensitivity and specificity were good to perfect. The original description and alternative 3 showed the strongest association with knee complaints. Conclusions The different descriptions of the K\&amp;L criteria have impact on the classification of osteoarthritis in the lowest grade (K\&amp;L>=1). All descriptions have strengths and weaknesses. It depends on the purpose which is the best description.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how the reading of knee radiographs by site investigators differs from that by an expert musculoskeletal radiologist who trained and validated them in a multicenter knee osteoarthritis (OA) study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A subset of participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative progression cohort was studied. Osteophytes and joint space narrowing (JSN) were evaluated using Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) and Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) grading. Radiographs were read by site investigators, who received training and validation of their competence by an expert musculoskeletal radiologist. Radiographs were re-read by this radiologist, who acted as a central reader. For KL and OARSI grading of osteophytes, discrepancies between two readings were adjudicated by another expert reader. RESULTS: Radiographs from 96 subjects (49 women) and 192 knees (138 KL grade>=2) were included. The site reading showed moderate agreement for KL grading overall (kappa=0.52) and for KL>=2 (i.e., radiographic diagnosis of "definite OA"; kappa=0.41). For OARSI grading, the site reading showed substantial agreement for lateral and medial JSN (kappa=0.65 and 0.71), but only fair agreement for osteophytes (kappa=0.37). For KL grading, the adjudicator's reading showed substantial agreement with the centralized reading (kappa=0.62), but only slight agreement with the site reading (kappa=0.10). CONCLUSION: Site investigators over-graded osteophytes compared to the central reader and the adjudicator. Different thresholds for scoring of JSN exist even between experts. Our results suggest that research studies using radiographic grading of OA should use a centralized reader for all grading.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: A previous systematic review on prognostic factors for knee osteoarthritis (OA) progression showed associations for generalized OA and hyaluronic acid levels. Knee pain, radiographic severity, sex, quadriceps strength, knee injury, and regular sport activities were not associated. It has been a decade since the literature search of that review and many studies have been performed since then investigating prognostic factors for radiographic knee OA progression. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study is to provide an updated systematic review of available evidence regarding prognostic factors for radiographic knee OA progression. METHODS: We searched for observational studies in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Key words were: knee, osteoarthritis (or arthritis, or arthrosis, or degenerative joint disease), progression (or prognosis, or precipitate, or predictive), and case-control (or cohort, or longitudinal, or follow-up). Studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were assessed for methodologic quality according to established criteria for reviews on prognostic factors in musculoskeletal disorders. Data were extracted and results were pooled if possible or summarized according to a best-evidence synthesis. A total of 1912 additional articles were identified; 43 met our inclusion criteria. The previous review contained 36 articles, thus providing a new total of 79 articles. Seventy-two of the included articles were scored high quality, the remaining seven were low quality. RESULTS: The pooled odds ratio (OR) of two determinants showed associations with knee OA progression: baseline knee pain (OR, 2.38 [95\% CI, 1.74{\^a}??3.27) and Heberden nodes (OR, 2.66 [95\% CI, 1.46{\^a}??8.84]). Our best-evidence synthesis showed strong evidence that varus alignment, serum hyaluronic acid, and tumor necrosis factor-{\^I}? are associated with knee OA progression. There is strong evidence that sex, former knee injury, quadriceps strength, smoking, running, and regular performance of sports are not associated with knee OA progression. Evidence for the majority of determined associations, however, was limited, conflicting, or inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline knee pain, presence of Heberden nodes, varus alignment, and high levels of serum markers hyaluronic acid and tumor necrosis factor-{\^I}? predict knee OA progression. Sex, knee injury, and quadriceps strength, among others, did not predict knee OA progression. Large variation remains in definitions of knee OA and knee OA progression. Clinical studies should use more consistent definitions of these factors to facilitate data pooling by future meta-analyses.

abstract={Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of joint disease and often characterized by cartilage changes. Accurate quantitative methods are needed to rapidly screen large image databases to assess changes in cartilage morphology. We therefore propose a new automatic atlas-based cartilage segmentation method for future automatic OA studies. Atlas-based segmentation methods have been demonstrated to be robust and accurate in brain imaging and therefore also hold high promise to allow for reliable and high-quality segmentations of cartilage. Nevertheless, atlas-based methods have not been well explored for cartilage segmentation. A particular challenge is the thinness of cartilage, its relatively small volume in comparison to surrounding tissue and the difficulty to locate cartilage interfaces {\^a}?? for example the interface between femoral and tibial cartilage. This paper focuses on the segmentation of femoral and tibial cartilage, proposing a multi-atlas segmentation strategy with non-local patch-based label fusion which can robustly identify candidate regions of cartilage. This method is combined with a novel three-label segmentation method which guarantees the spatial separation of femoral and tibial cartilage, and ensures spatial regularity while preserving the thin cartilage shape through anisotropic regularization. Our segmentation energy is convex and therefore guarantees globally optimal solutions. We perform an extensive validation of the proposed method on 706 images of the Pfizer Longitudinal Study. Our validation includes comparisons of different atlas segmentation strategies, different local classifiers, and different types of regularizers. To compare to other cartilage segmentation approaches we validate based on the 50 images of the SKI10 dataset.},

abstract={Reproducibility verification is essential to the practice of the scientific method. Researchers report their findings, which are strengthened as other independent groups in the scientific community share similar outcomes. In the many scientific fields where software has become a fundamental tool for capturing and analyzing data, this requirement of reproducibility implies that reliable and comprehensive software platforms and tools should be made available to the scientific community. The tools will empower them and the public to verify, through practice, the reproducibility of observations that are reported in the scientific literature. Medical image analysis is one of the fields in which the use of computational resources, both software and hardware, are an essential platform for performing experimental work. In this arena, the introduction of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) in 1999 has transformed the field and facilitates its progress by accelerating the rate at which algorithmic implementations are developed, tested, disseminated and improved. By building on the efficiency and quality of open source methodologies, ITK has provided the medical image community with an effective platform on which to build a daily workflow that incorporates the true scientific practices of reproducibility verification. This article describes the multiple tools, methodologies, and practices that the ITK community has adopted, refined, and followed during the past decade, in order to become one of the research communities with the most modern reproducibility verification infrastructure. For example, 207 contributors have created over 2400 unit tests that provide over 84\% code line test coverage. The Insight Journal, an open publication journal associated with the toolkit, has seen over 360,000 publication downloads. The median normalized closeness centrality, a measure of knowledge flow, resulting from the distributed peer code review system was high, 0.46.},

abstract={Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside. 3D Slicer is a free open source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm, and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer.},

abstract={Publicly available scientific resources help establish evaluation standards, provide a platform for teaching and improve reproducibility. Version 4 of the Insight ToolKit (ITK(4)) seeks to establish new standards in publicly available image registration methodology. ITK(4) makes several advances in comparison to previous versions of ITK. ITK(4) supports both multivariate images and objective functions; it also unifies high-dimensional (deformation field) and low-dimensional (affine) transformations with metrics that are reusable across transform types and with composite transforms that allow arbitrary series of geometric mappings to be chained together seamlessly. Metrics and optimizers take advantage of multi-core resources, when available. Furthermore, ITK(4) reduces the parameter optimization burden via principled heuristics that automatically set scaling across disparate parameter types (rotations vs. translations). A related approach also constrains steps sizes for gradient-based optimizers. The result is that tuning for different metrics and/or image pairs is rarely necessary allowing the researcher to more easily focus on design/comparison of registration strategies. In total, the ITK(4) contribution is intended as a structure to support reproducible research practices, will provide a more extensive foundation against which to evaluate new work in image registration and also enable application level programmers a broad suite of tools on which to build. Finally, we contextualize this work with a reference registration evaluation study with application to pediatric brain labeling.},

abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

abstract={The agreement between measurements and the relative performance reproducibility among different microcomputed tomography (microCT) systems, especially at voxel sizes close to the limit of the instruments, is not known. To compare this reproducibility 3D morphometric analyses of mouse cancellous bone from distal femoral epiphyses were performed using three different ex vivo microCT systems: GE eXplore Locus SP, Scanco {\^I}?CT35 and Skyscan 1172. Scans were completed in triplicate at 12{\^I}?m and 8{\^I}?m voxel sizes and morphometry measurements, from which relative values and dependence on voxel size were examined. Global and individual visually assessed thresholds were compared. Variability from repeated scans at 12{\^I}?m voxel size was also examined. Bone volume fraction and trabecular separation values were similar, while values for relative bone surface, trabecular thickness and number varied significantly across the three systems. The greatest differences were measured in trabecular thickness (up to 236\%) and number (up to 218\%). The relative dependence of measurements on voxel size was highly variable for the trabecular number (from 0\% to 20\% relative difference between measurements from 12{\^I}?m and 8{\^I}?m voxel size scans, depending on the system). The intra-system reproducibility of all trabecular measurements was also highly variable across the systems and improved for BV/TV in all the systems when a smaller voxel size was used. It improved using a smaller voxel size in all the other parameters examined for the Scanco system, but not consistently so for the GE or the Skyscan system. Our results indicate trabecular morphometry measurements should not be directly compared across microCT systems. In addition, the conditions, including voxel size, for trabecular morphometry studies in mouse bone should be chosen based on the specific microCT system and the measurements of main interest.},
